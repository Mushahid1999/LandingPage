# LandingPage
## Used HTML to make my own personalized landing page/portfolio that has background information on myself and projects that I have created as well
  * All necessary folders and files are in the parent folder "html5up-hyperspace". 
  * Within the html5up folder, I opened "index" file which contained my HTML that I used through my code editor of choice was visual studio code in this case
  * Link to my landing page: file:///C:/Users/Mushahid/Tech/HeadStarter/html5up-hyperspace/index.html
